(defmacro letr
  "Let bindings, plus early return.

  You want to do some complicated, multi-stage operation assigning lots of
  variables--but at different points in the let binding, you need to perform
  some conditional check to make sure you can proceed to the next step.
  Ordinarily, you'd intersperse let and if statements, like so:

      (let [res (network-call)]
        (if-not (:ok? res)
          :failed-network-call

          (let [people (:people (:body res))]
            (if (zero? (count people))
              :no-people

              (let [res2 (network-call-2 people)]
                ...

  This is a linear chain of operations, but we're forced to nest deeply because
  we have no early-return construct. In ruby, we might write

      res = network_call
      return :failed_network_call if not x.ok?

      people = res[:body][:people]
      return :no-people if people.empty?

      res2 = network_call_2 people
      ...

  which reads the same, but requires no nesting thanks to Ruby's early return.
  Clojure's single-return is *usually* a boon to understandability, but deep
  linear branching usually means something like

  - Deep nesting         (readability issues)
  - Function chaining    (lots of arguments for bound variables)
  - Throw/catch          (awkward exception wrappers)
  - Monadic interpreter  (slow, indirect)

  This macro lets you write:

      (letr [res    (network-call)
             _      (when-not (:ok? res) (return :failed-network-call))
             people (:people (:body res))
             _      (when (zero? (count people)) (return :no-people))
             res2   (network-call-2 people)]
        ...)

  letr works like let, but if (return x) is ever returned from a binding, letr
  returns x, and does not evaluate subsequent expressions.

  If something other than (return x) is returned from evaluating a binding,
  letr binds the corresponding variable as normal. Here, we use _ to indicate
  that we're not using the results of (when ...), but this is not mandatory.
  You cannot use a destructuring bind for a return expression.

  letr is not a *true* early return--(return x) must be a *terminal* expression
  for it to work--like (recur). For example,

      (letr [x (do (return 2) 1)]
        x)

  returns 1, not 2, because (return 2) was not the terminal expression. Someone
  clever should fix this.

  (return ...) only works within letr's bindings, not its body."
